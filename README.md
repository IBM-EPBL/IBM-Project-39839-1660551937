Web Phishing Detection

![197326623-16b85aa5-ac66-4348-bd0b-4e85cf68cae0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116282481/202834714-6077bc39-cbd5-4257-89c2-51e9024fa3a2.jpg)

A lot of customers utilise e-banking to pay for their online purchases of goods. There are e-banking websites that, frequently for malevolent purposes, request users to provide confidential material including login, password, and credit card details. A phishing website is one that offers this kind of e-banking service. One of the essential software services for Internet communications is the web service. A number of security risks to web services on the Internet include web phishing.

Web phishing dangers that are often encountered include:

Through the use of a fake website, a practise known as web phishing, the goal is to get sensitive data including usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers. Damage to property and information leakage are the results. Numerous scams have the potential to target large enterprises.
Applying a machine-learning algorithm to identify phishing websites is the major goal of this guided project.
We suggested a clever, adaptable, and successful method that is based on applying classification algorithms in order to identify and anticipate e-banking phishing websites. We used classification methods and approaches to extract the phishing datasets' eligibility criteria and interpret them.
The e-banking phishing website may be identified using various key features, including the URL and domain identification, security and encryption requirements, and the overall phishing detection rate. Once a user completes an online transaction and pays through an e-banking website, our system uses a data mining algorithm to determine if the e-banking website is legitimate or a phishing website.


Common threats of web phishing:

Web phishing aims to steal private information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, by way of impersonating a legitimate entity.
It will lead to information disclosure and property damage.
Large organizations may get trapped in different kinds of scams.
This Guided Project mainly focuses on applying a machine-learning algorithm to detect Phishing websites.
In order to detect and predict e-banking phishing websites, we proposed an intelligent, flexible and effective system that is based on using classification algorithms. We implemented classification algorithms and techniques to extract the phishing datasets criteria to classify their legitimacy. The e-banking phishing website can be detected based on some important characteristics like URL and domain identity, and security and encryption criteria in the final phishing detection rate. Once a user makes a transaction online when he makes payment through an e-banking website our system will use a data mining algorithm to detect whether the e-banking website is a phishing website or not.
